    <!--The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the same directory as the current page.
      We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.
      The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".
      You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".-->
    <h1>Information on Whales</h1>
    <!--use relative url to link to new page show the infomation when mouse over on it and open a new tab when click-->
    <p>For more information on our conservation activities and which Whales we study,
